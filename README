/**
* Ghost Text is used to present default text inside of an input and then clear it when the user
* gives focus. When the user exits (blurs) the input, if they have not entered their own value
* the ghost text is then put back in the input.
*
*
* Options {
*       ghostText: The text you want to use as the ghost text for this input
*           default - current value when .ghostText() is called
*
*       ghostClass: The class to add to the input while the ghost text is present
*           default - 'ghost-text'
*
*       focus: A custom callback for when the input gains focus
*           default - null
*
*       blur: A custom callback for when the input is blurred
*           default - null
*
*       change: A custom callback for when the input value changes
*           default - null
*
*       clearOnSubmit: A boolean saying whether or not to clear the input when the parent
*               form is submitted if it still has the default ghost text in it.
*           default - true
*
*       parentForm: The ID of the parent form to attach the submit event too
*           default - A search to find the form using $self.closest('form')
*   }
